I'm programmer and social sciences student. Profesionally, I mostly develop for web platform, but I tinker with computers in general. I'm eclectic in my choice of programming languages and tools.
Member of [druit.org](https://druit.org/) cooperative and [nolog.cz](https://nolog.cz/) collective.

My areas of interest:

- Web development (TypeScript, HTML, CSS)
- Low-complexity, server-oriented, multi-page approaches to front-end development with classical MVC frameworks, paired tools like [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) or [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) and sprinkled with laser-focused JavaScript. Champion of [Hypermedia systems](https://hypermedia.systems/); adversary of redundantly overcomplicated and resource-munching frontend stacks.
- High-concurrency, fault-tolerant systems in Elixir, Erlang/OTP, Phoenix.
- Computational typesetting with [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), [Pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/) and [ConTeXt](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page).
