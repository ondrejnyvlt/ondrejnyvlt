âœ¨ I'm programmer & anthropology student. I mostly program websites and web applications, but I like to tinker with computers in general. 

I am very eclectic when it comes to the choice of technologies and programming languages, but I have preference for functional programming and static type-checking.

Due to my dislike of big tech and [the fact that GitHub violates copyright laws](https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com/), I'm in process of moving over my code to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ondrejnyvlt), which is run by non-profit. See me there.
